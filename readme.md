# Park Search App

[https://orndorfftyler.github.io/park-search/](https://orndorfftyler.github.io/park-search/)

This app lets the user search for parks using the National Park Service API. This was one of the first apps I built that sent requests to an API using fetch and then displayed search results using the response from the API. Before sending a request to the API, it checks the search input and displays an error message if the input needs adjusting. An error message will also be displayed if there is something wrong with the API response.

Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery.
